- name: QMK TextFlow
  description: |
    A QMK feature that introduces a powerful text generation
     system, enabling runtime definition of control clauses,
     variables, procedures, and functions using the "Compose"
     key to control keyboard output interactively.
  details:
    - |
     Enhances QMK-powered keyboards with advanced text
      generation and customization capabilities.
    - |
     Uses a "Compose" key to activate and deactivate the 
     TextFlow interpreter for on-the-fly macro creation and
     manipulation.
    - |
     Provides conditional execution to selectively execute
      certain parts of a macro based on conditions like the
      value of a variable or user input.
    - |
     Retains user-defined global variables, functions, and
      procedures across sessions until deallocated or the
      keyboard powers off.
  features:
    - |
      Flow control statements, such as "if-then", "while-do",
       and "for-next" loops
    - |
      Mathematical functions for arithmetic operations like
       addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    - |
      User-defined functions and procedures, enabling advanced
       macro creation and customization
    - |
      String manipulation functions for concatenation,
       substring extraction, and character replacement
    - |
      Date and time functions for retrieving and formatting
       dates and times
    - |
      Allows users to process data in real-time, such as
       filtering, sorting, or reformatting incoming data streams
       from sensors, logs, or other sources.
    - |
      Intuitive and efficient use of the "Compose" key for
       entering and exiting the TextFlow interpreter, making it
       easy for users to create and manage their custom macros.
